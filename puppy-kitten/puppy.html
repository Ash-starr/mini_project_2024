               <h2>How Are Puppies’ Nutritional Needs Differ from Dog's?</h2>
               <p>Puppies have different dietary needs than adult dogs or humans. While they grow, play, and learn, they
                  require specific nutrition to support their developing bodies. Their food should be more energy-dense
                  to fuel their rapid growth and have the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for healthy bone
                  development. Since puppies can have a difficult time regulating their food intake, it's important for
                  you to control their portions. Eating too much and growing too fast can lead to obesity and various
                  health issues, affecting their quality of life, including bone and joint problems and digestive
                  disorders.</p>

               <h2>How much should you feed your puppy?</h2>
               <p>As your puppy grows, their feeding schedule will change.

                  During weaning, divide daily meals into at least four portions. For small breed dogs, stick to at
                  least four meals a day until they're four months old, then switch to at least two meals a day until
                  ten months. Larger breeds should also have at least three meals a day until they're six months old,
                  then switch to at least two meals a day until a year.

                  It's important to note that dogs don’t need dietary variety like humans do. They thrive on a
                  consistent food routine, which can start from their early months: same food, same bowl, same
                  times—every day. </p>

               <h2>Feeding your Puppy: the basics</h2>
               <p>If you’re worried you don’t know what to feed your new puppy and when, there are a few things you
                  should know:<br><br>

                  <b>Transitioning to Solids</b>Puppies rely on their mother’s milk for the first few weeks, gaining
                  vital antibodies.Introduce solid foods during weaning. Puppy-specific wet or dry food
                  works well. Moisten dry food with water or milk replacer at first. <br><br>

                  <b>Gradual Diet Changes:</b> Always transition new foods over a week to avoid upsetting their
                  stomach.<br><br>

                  <b>Moistening Food: </b> Start with moistened dry food for younger puppies, transitioning to dry
                  kibble as their teeth develop.<br><br>
               </p>

               <h2>How do your puppy’s healthy development needs change?</h2>
               <p>Puppies' dietary needs change as they grow into adulthood, which happens at different ages depending
                  on their breed size. Larger breeds like Labrador Retrievers reach adulthood around 15 months, while
                  smaller ones like Jack Russell Terriers do so around 10 months. <br><br>
                  <b>Birth to 1 Month:</b>During the first month, puppies transition from mother's milk to solid food,
                  needing balanced nutrients to support their delicate digestive system. <br><br>

                  <b>2 to 4 Month:</b>From 4 to 10 months, puppies continue to build mass and need protein-rich food to
                  support growth. Overfeeding can cause issues, so follow recommended portions based on breed and age.
                  <br><br>

                  <b>4 to 7 Month:</b> From 10 months to adulthood, puppies need extra support for joint health,
                  particularly for larger breeds. Adjust their food intake accordingly and seek advice from a feeding
                  chart or your vet if needed.
                  <br><br>

                  <b>10 Months to adulthood:</b> Canned or pouched, wet food is an alternative or a complement to dry
                  food and
                  removes
                  the need to add water. Many kittens and adult cats eat a mixed diet of dry and wet food.

                  <p>A well-mannered dog doesn't just happen by accident; it requires consistent and creative
                     teaching. Puppies' brains are receptive to learning manners, house training, and safety skills.
                     Therefore, incorporating consistent play and training methods will help. <br><br>
                     Puppy training offers numerous benefits. For example:<br><br>
                     <b>Physical activity-</b>helps burn off their excess energy. <br>
                     <b>Cognitive skills- </b>play that involves reasoning enhances their problem-solving and memory
                     skills. <br><br>
                     Playtime also provides an opportunity to teach your puppy how to act and interact. Behaviors like
                     biting, nipping, herding, and jumping can be dangerous around young children and adults. Puppies
                     learn acceptable behavior through socialization and playtime. These sessions help set the tone for
                     how you want them to behave as they get older.

                  As well as the obvious benefits to maintaining your puppy's coat health, as well as eye, ear, and nose
                  hygiene, grooming is an excellent way to familiarize yourself with your puppy's healthy skin, so it's

                  handled from an early age. If a dog is carefully introduced to grooming from puppyhood, the experience
                  will be less stressful for them, and calmer for you in the future.
