               Kittenhood is a stage of massive physical and behavioural changes. Nutrition tailored to their specific

                        <p>There are some houseplants, like lilies, for instance, that can be toxic to your cat. Ask
                           your veterinarian for a full list and, ideally, remove them from the house before the arrival
                           of the kitten. See the ASPCA for a list of all toxic plants for your kitten.</p>

                           lids down. Also, keep your kitten away from any type of discarded string as they may become

                           For example, some flea treatments for dogs are dangerous for cats and antifreeze is
                           particularly lethal for them. See the ASPCA for a list of all toxic household substances.</p>

                           places where your kitten’s likely to hide and either block them off or be careful as you move
                           around your home to make sure they don’t get trapped.

                           digestive issues. These toxic foods include, but are not limited to, onions, garlic, raw
                           eggs, raw meat, chocolate, cow's milk, grapes, and raisins. So keep your food out of your

               <h2>How do my kitten's nutritional needs differ from an adult cat's?</h2>
               <p>As kittens are growing rapidly, and their digestive and immune systems are developing slowly, they
                  have very specific nutritional needs that are different from adult cats. In particular, kittens need a
                  diet with a higher energy and protein content, plus vitamins and minerals that support the immune
                  system and the development of healthy organs, muscles and skeleton.</p>
               <h2>What does my kitten need from its first food?</h2>
               <p>As well as satisfying your kitten’s unique nutritional requirements, their first food should be
                  suitable for their young digestive system and teeth. For felines in general, the smell and texture of
                  food are bigger deciding factors than taste. As kittens retain their milk teeth until 4-6 months old,
                  it’s important to select a dry formula that is easy to chew and complement it with a wet formula that
                  eases the weaning process. It is beneficial to introduce your kitten to wet food early as it can have
                  health benefits and may be difficult to introduce later in life.</p>
               <h2>Feeding your kitten: the basics</h2>
               <p>If you’re worried you don’t know what to feed your new kitten and when, there are a few things you
                  should know:<br><br>

                  <b>From milk to solids:</b> We recommend introducing solid foods when weaning the kittens. This starts
                  at
                  4-4.5 weeks. You may decide to use a Mother and Baby cat food so that the mother and her kittens are
                  eating the same food. <br><br>

                  <b>Easy to chew:</b> You can use soft, wet foods, which are easy
                  to eat and will help your kitten transition to solid food. Or you can use dry foods. Bear in mind that
                  dry food is harder to chew, so if you decide to use it, start by adding water or a kitten milk
                  replacer to moisten it. Over time, progressively add less and less liquid until your kitten is only
                  eating dry food.<br><br>

                  <b>A gradual transition:</b> Kittens are very sensitive to change, so always make sure you transition
                  to new
                  food over the course of a week so your kitten can get used to their new diet. <br><br>

                  <b>Less and often:</b> Up to around 6 months when your kitten's stomach is still small, you may decide
                  to
                  feed your cat with smaller portions 4-6 times a day. As they grow into an adult, you can transition to
                  twice a day, as they can handle larger portions in one meal. Alternatively, you can leave out their
                  entire daily recommended portion of dry food and let them eat at their own pace - but you must remove
                  any leftovers after 24 hours. <br><br>
               </p>
               <h2>Key foods for your kitten</h2>
               <p><b>Milk:</b> When they’re first born, your kitten will exclusively drink its mother’s milk, if she is
                  able to
                  provide it. Colostrum is the first milk of the mother and it provides vital antibodies to pass on
                  immunity to kittens in this early part of their development. <br><br>

                  <b>Milk replacer and formula:</b> If your kitten is not with its mother or their mother cannot provide
                  milk,
                  you can use kitten milk replacers. Specially formulated, replacers offer all the benefits and
                  nutrients of their mother’s milk and should be used until your kitten is weaned onto solid foods.
                  <br><br>

                  <b>Dry kitten food:</b> Dry food such as kibble is a great option for kittens. For young kittens, you
                  can
                  introduce dry food by moistening it with water or kitten milk replacer, to make it easier to chew
                  <br><br>

                  <b>Wet kitten food:</b> Canned or pouched, wet food is an alternative or a complement to dry food and
                  removes
                  the need to add water. Many kittens and adult cats eat a mixed diet of dry and wet food.

                     <p>Protein plays a vital role in healthy kitten development by forming and renewing tissue, muscle,

                        and one which should be used as efficiently as possible. Proteins are composed of chains of
                        hundreds (or even thousands) of amino acids. There are 20 amino acids present in proteins and
                        they are classified into two different types: essential and non-essential. Essential amino acids
                        can not be made by the kittens body in sufficient amounts for healthy functioning and
                        development, and therefore must be present in food. Non-essential amino acids can derive from
                        excesses of essential dietary amino acids, but they are still vital to healthy function and
                        should form part of a balanced diet.</p>

                        give them medication. Training can help your kitten to adjust to these unfamiliar experiences
                        and cope with new situations, so they stay calm and don't react aggressively</p>

                           recognize</li>
                        <li>Call your kitten by their name for feeding or play, and repeat their name during the
                           activity. This positive reinforcement will help your cat to recognize the name</li>
                        <li>Try not to repeat the name when punishing your kitten as this will give the name a negative
                           connotation</li>

                        <li>Kittens are often more responsive when they are hungry. So try these exercises before

                  Introducing your kitten to grooming from an early age can be a great bonding experience for you and
                  your new pet.
                  Your kitten will also grow accustomed to being handled, which will make grooming less stressful for
                  them,
                  and calmer for you in the future.

                  <h1>How to brush a kitten</h1>
                  <p>While kittens can often manage their own grooming routine, regular brushing can remove any loose
                     hair and dirt build-up that could otherwise cause hairballs.The brushing process can start from the
                     head, slowly moving first to the front legs and chest, then
                     to the hind legs, and finally the tail. Your brush or comb should first move with the direction of
                     the coat, then against to loosen any dead hair and debris.
                     The appropriate frequency of brushing and necessary tools will depend on the type of coat.</p>
