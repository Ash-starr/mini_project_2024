               Kittenhood is a stage of massive physical and behavioural changes. Nutrition tailored to their specific

                     <li>Finding a veterinarian</li>
                     <li>Choosing appropriate kitten food - you can discuss this with your breeder, shelter

                  in your home before you bring your kitten to make sure it’s safe for them. Here’s our checklist to

                        <p>There are some houseplants, like lilies, for instance, that can be toxic to your cat. Ask
                           your veterinarian for a full list and, ideally, remove them from the house before the arrival
                           of the kitten. See the ASPCA for a list of all toxic plants for your kitten.</p>

                           lids down. Also, keep your kitten away from any type of discarded string as they may become

                           For example, some flea treatments for dogs are dangerous for cats and antifreeze is
                           particularly lethal for them. See the ASPCA for a list of all toxic household substances.</p>

                           places where your kitten’s likely to hide and either block them off or be careful as you move
                           around your home to make sure they don’t get trapped.

                           using covers or cable ties. Remember to shield electrical outlets with covers.</p>

                           digestive issues. These toxic foods include, but are not limited to, onions, garlic, raw
                           eggs, raw meat, chocolate, cow's milk, grapes, and raisins. So keep your food out of your
